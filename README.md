# aardwolfclientpackage-installer
Installer creation scripts for https://github.com/fiendish/aardwolfclientpackage

1. Put these files above the MUSHclient directory
2. Use MakeNSIS or MakeNSISW to compile aardmush_installer.nsi

I use it in GNU/Linux with Wine by:
`wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/NSIS/makensis.exe aardmush_installer.nsi`

I imagine the Windows invocation is not strikingly dissimilar.
